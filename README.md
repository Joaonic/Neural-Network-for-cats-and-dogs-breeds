# Neural-Network-for-cats-and-dogs-breeds
Creation of a neural network utilizing Keras with Tensorflow to classify dog and cats breeds using Convolutional Networks.

The images used in this project were taken from Kaggle.

The code starts by classifying the images in two classes (cats and dogs), where an accuracy rate of 98% has been achieved. 
Then it will make a categorization between the dog or cat breeds, previously classified.

The training and test datasets are distributed on a 80%/20%~~ rate.

As soon as the datasets of the breeds of dogs and cats are pre-processed and the neural network for each one is made, parameterized correctly and trained,
I will add the codes to the repository
